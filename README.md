# UK-Census-Project
This is a mock census of an imaginary or non-existent town. The aim is to compare different people or households across the town
This was carried out to aid the Government and local authorities in planning on what to do with an unoccupied plot of land and advise on where or how to allocate investment funding.
To be able to do these, firstly, the census data has been cleaned to correct data structure errors, missing entries, and false or incorrect entries, which is detailed in a section of this report.

	Conclusive Analysis
High-density and Low-density housing; the age pyramid reveals that the population is not growing very much, indicating that high-density housing is therefore not required. However, based on the occupancy count per dwelling, the houses are overcrowded. Low-density housing might be a viable solution to housing problems.
Commuters in the town; the number of commuters in the town is relatively large, as evidenced by an analysis of the number of commuters in the town, which includes religious and occupational commuters. I would have advocated for the construction of a university to minimize travel, but this would only benefit occupational commuters, not religious commuters. Similarly, constructing another religious place of worship would only benefit one faith, making it a non-viable alternative.
Emergency medical building; an examination of infirmity reveals that it affects just a tiny fraction of the population, indicating that it does not affect a considerable number of individuals. As a result, constructing an emergency medical facility would be unnecessary.
Employment and training; the town has a high rate of unemployment, and the majority of unemployed persons are from the dominating age group (middle-aged). According to the US Bureau of Labor Statistics (2015) a high unemployment rate will result in sluggish economic growth since it diminishes family income and hence purchasing power 
Old age care; when compared to other age groups, the number of retired and elderly people in the population is much lower and decreasing. Investing in old-aged care homes should not be a primary focus.
Increased spending for schooling; should not be a primary concern, since the number of new births is in a decrease.
General infrastructure; Calculating the Crude Growth Rate (CGR) reveals that there are more people dying than new births, indicating that the mortality rate exceeds the birth rate. In summation, for every birth, there are two more deaths. This demonstrates that the population is not increasing, and therefore there is no need to invest in more infrastructure.

	Recommendations
In conclusion, I would propose or recommend the following to the government;
Because there are a lot of commuters in the town, from occupational commuters (university students and university staff) to religious commuters, the unoccupied land should be allocated to constructing a train station. Another alternative would be to develop low-density housing, however, this would only be viable if the populace is affluent. We are unable to justify this based on the data or information provided.
I would recommend that the government invests funding into providing employment and training on new skills, to address the concerns of high unemployment and under-employment respectively.
